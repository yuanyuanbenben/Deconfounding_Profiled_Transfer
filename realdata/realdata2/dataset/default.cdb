This variable was created as part of a series of summation variables after it 
became apparent that the rules for the key variables for setting the key to NA 
if any component was missing resulted in too many Rs being missing on the key 
variables. The summation series is a simple addition of all positive and 
negative values. This variable was revised in 2016 to fix the problem of 
noninterviews being assigned to zero and fix the problem of adding a few 
components that were missing on the original summation variables. Always use the
revised version (R00623.20)
